    **View security dashboard** to open Windows Security. Ensure that you donâ€™t see the Device performance & health icon.

    _Note: This is because settings that prevent showing device and performance health were applied from Intune._

2.  Switch to **LON-CL1** and open **Windows Security**. Ensure that you see the device performance & health icon. 

    _Note: This is because LON-CL1 is not enrolled to Intune._
