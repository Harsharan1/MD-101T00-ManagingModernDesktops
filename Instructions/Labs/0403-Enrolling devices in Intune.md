# Practice Lab - Enrolling devices in Intune

## Summary

In this lab, you will practice enrolling a client in Azure AD and Intune reviewing the post-enrollment experience.

### Scenario

Joni Sherman will be testing the process of joining a device, LON-CL4, to the domain and enrolling in Intune. After IT verifies the device is not currently joined, Joni should login using her credentials. 
Joni should then reboot the device to verify organizational settings, such as Windows Hello, are enabled. 

### Task 1: Verify that a Windows 10 device is not enrolled in Intune or Azure AD

    **Pa55w.rd**

2.  Select **Start**, type **certlm.msc**, press Enter and then select **Yes**.

3.  In the **Certificates** console, in the navigation pane, select **Personal**
    and verify that the following certificates are not listed in the details
    pane:

-   Microsoft Intune MDM Device CA

-   MS-Organization-Access

-   MS-Organization-P2P-Access [2018]

    _Note: This will indicate that the device is not enrolled in Azure AD or Intune._

5.  Right-click **Start**, and then select **Windows PowerShell (Admin)**. When
    prompted select **Yes**.

6.  In the PowerShell console, type the following and press Enter:
```
 dsregcmd /status

```
7.  In the output under **Device State**, verify that **AzureAdJoined : NO** is
    displayed.

8.  Close the PowerShell window.

### Task 2: Enroll a Windows 10 device to Azure AD and Intune using Settings app

_Note:  This lab is practice enrolling a non-domain joined device. LON-CL4 must first be removed from the domain to continue this lab._

    **Settings** app.

2.  In the **Settings** app, select the **Accounts**.

    This indicates that the device is enrolled in Intune.

### Task 4A: Logon to a Windows 10 Device using Azure AD user (Phone verification)

_Note: this task requires the use of your mobile phone in order to be validated by Microsoft. The task is optional but recommended as it will demonstrate how to setup Windows Hello, the first time you login using your Azure AD credentials. If you prefer or are unable to sign in with phone verification, go to **Task 4B**._

When you're logged on using your Azure AD credentials you will benefit from
Single-Sign-On (SSO) to Azure AD, Intune and Office 365.

1.  On **LON-CL4**, sign out of LON-CL4.

2.  Select **other user**, and in the **Email address** field type
    **JoniS\@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com**. In the password, type the password
    for the user and then press Enter.

    country or region** box, select your country and in the **Phone Number**
    field, type your phone number. Then select **Next**.

8.  Wait for a text message to arrive on your phone, type the 6-digit security
    code in the **Enter Your security code** field and select **Next**.

9.  When the verification is successful, select **Done**.

10.  In the **Set up a PIN** dialog box, type **112233** in the **New PIN** and
    **Confirm PIN field** and select **OK**.

11. On the **All set!** screen, select **OK**.

_Note: Continue to Task 5._

### Task 4B: Logon to a Windows 10 Device using Azure AD user (no phone verification)

    select **Sign out**.

2.  Select **Other user**, and in the **Email address** field type
    **JoniS**\@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com**, and** in the **Password** field,

    text box and press **Enter**. In the navigation pane, select **Devices**.

2.  On the **Devices** blade under Intune enrolled devices, verify that 1 is
    displayed next to **Windows**. If no devices are listed refresh the webpage
    and repeat steps 1 and 2.

3.  On the **Devices** blade, select **All devices** and verify that **Marketing-###**
    is listed.

    _Note: LON-CL4 is not shown because the device was renamed in the Provisioning
    Package exercise earlier in the course._

4.  On the **Devices** blade, select **Azure AD devices** and verify that
    **Markeing-###** and the device from the Autpilot lab.  Note that the **MDM** column
    displays **Microsoft Intune**.  
    
    _Note: This view lists devices that are joined to Azure AD. Remember that you
    configured integration between Azure AD and Intune, and because of that, any
    device that is joined to Azure AD is automatically enrolled to Intune. Any devices
    joined prior to setting up enrollment are only joined to Azure AD, but not enrolled
    in Intune._

5.  Close all Windows.
